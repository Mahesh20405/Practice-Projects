# Spam Detection Using Machine Learning

## Description
This project implements a spam detection system using machine learning. The model is trained on the SMS Spam Collection Dataset and uses a Naive Bayes classifier to detect spam messages.

## Features
i. Preprocesses SMS text data by removing non-alphabet characters, converting to lowercase, and removing stopwords.
ii. Uses a Naive Bayes classifier for detecting spam messages.
iii. Saves the trained model and vectorizer for future use.
iv. Provides a function for predicting whether a new message is spam or not.
